
# Mobile Apps Evaluated

Since vSoC focus on the usage of shared memory
among mobile SoC devices, we choose five types (10 apps each) of emerging apps that involve frequent processing between SoC devices. For each category, we choose the top-10 apps from Google Play (as of Mar. 2024) listed below.

Note: for AR apps, since the Google ARCore framework is not supported on most emulators, we select the top-10 apps that can run without Google ARCore. For livestream apps, we select the top-10 apps that support streaming over local area networks to minimize the impact of network instabilities on the results.
